<h2>Top 3 Movie and Anime and Series Recommendation</h2>

<hr>

<h3>1. Harry Potter</h3>
<p><b>The Best</b> movie ever to be made, whoever's watched knows it is the best and always will be the best.</p>

<h3>2. Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>The earlier parts in the franchise were the best ones made yet, just because it had common emotion, but now its all about action, but previously it had races, fights and everthing.</p>

<h3>3. Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>I haven't watched that much anime's yet, but I don't think any anime will Demon Slayer for me, due the connect I made with Kyojuro Rengoku in the Mugen Train Arc. And the animations are just stunning.</p>
